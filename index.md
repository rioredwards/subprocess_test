* **Choose Your Own Adventure**: Users can have quests generated completely at random, or they may specify certain parameters, such as the time limit, and the programming language.
* **Realistic Challenges**: Code Quest will never create a quest that doesn't make sense (eg: CLI quest using React). A sophisticated algorithm ensures that any quest generated is feasible.
* **Intuitive UI**: The UI was designed to resemble a slot machine, giving the app a familiar feel and making it easy to get started. If you do get stuck, there is a built-in help menu to explain the various features.
* **Smooth Animations**: This app makes heavy use of the Framer Motion animation library, which brings the UI to life!
* **Custom Artwork**: All artwork is custom-made, giving Code Quest a unique look and feel.
* **Well Vetted**: The creator of this app, **_Rio Edwards_**, has completed nearly 100 coding challenges and projects similar to the ones generated by Code Quest. You can trust these challenges are practical and relevant to real-world coding scenarios.
