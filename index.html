<ul><li><p><b>Choose Your Own Adventure</b>: Users can have quests generated completely at random, or they may specify certain parameters, such as the time limit, and the programming language.</p></li><li><p><b>Realistic Challenges</b>: Code Quest will never create a quest that doesn&#39;t make sense (eg: CLI quest using React). A sophisticated algorithm ensures that any quest generated is feasible.</p></li><li><p><b>Intuitive UI</b>: The UI was designed to resemble a slot machine, giving the app a familiar feel and making it easy to get started. If you do get stuck, there is a built-in help menu to explain the various features.</p></li><li><p><b>Smooth Animations</b>: This app makes heavy use of the Framer Motion animation library, which brings the UI to life!</p></li><li><p><b>Custom Artwork</b>: All artwork is custom-made, giving Code Quest a unique look and feel.</p></li><li><p><b>Well Vetted</b>: The creator of this app, <b><i>Rio Edwards</i></b>, has completed nearly 100 coding challenges and projects similar to the ones generated by Code Quest. You can trust these challenges are practical and relevant to real-world coding scenarios.</p></li></ul><p></p>
